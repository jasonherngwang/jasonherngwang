# Welcome!

I’m Jason, a software engineer at Cohere Health, where we aim improve the patient healthcare experience by streamlining the prior authorization process.

My experience is in JavaScript, Python, React, Tailwind, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, and AWS, and I’m enthusiastic about learning anything to help the team succeed. I also have a background in mechanical engineering - leading clean energy projects, automating processes, and managing cross-functional efforts.

Recently, I collaborated with a remote team to create Seamless, an open-source CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.

Feel free to reach out if you need help or want to chat!
